===============


Information about the TR-064 protocol with services and actions as well as AVM-specific extensions are listed at the `AVM support-page <https://avm.de/service/schnittstellen/>`_ (this specific webpage about programming interfaces is mainly in german language, but the detailed documentation-files (PDFs) are in english).

Everything that can be done by means of this API - used by fritzconnection - is documented there.
